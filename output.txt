> Today, I am beginning my adventure as a POKéMON TRAINER! I'm excited to begin my journey and attempt to complete my POKéDEX!
I'm off to the professor to get my starter - I hope it will be a cute one!
Oh, and also, I will document my daily activities here in this document. By the end of my trip, I'm sure to be a POKéMON master, right?
Alright, let's go!

> The meeting with the professor went great! There were tons of POKéMON on offer but I eventually settled on one that caught my eye: NUZLEAF!
Naturally, it's Lv. 100 and already has the moveset SOLAR-BEAM, NATURE-POWER, HEADBUTT, and RETURN.
I wonder where the professor found something like this? Whatever, it's gotta be strong!
According to them, my NUZLEAF has a NAUGHTY nature and the ability CHLOROPHYLL. That'll definitely come in handy.
Oh, I was also given a POKéDEX! This is what it had to say about my NUZLEAF:
* They live in holes bored in large trees. The sound
of Nuzleaf’s grass flute fills listeners with dread.
I can't wait to see what else I'll learn about POKéMON with this! The professor gave me a ton of POKéBALLS so I should be good to go.

Apparently it is Lv. 92 and has a NAUGHTY nature. Seems to know ASTONISH, ABSORB, FACADE, and TOXIC!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:

That is how it began to live floating in the water.
Score! Just glorious.

a well-built adult. Striving to become ever stronger, Machop
trains by carrying a Graveler on its shoulders.

Apparently it is Lv. 4 and has a LAX nature. Seems to know FACADE, DIVE, FAKE-TEARS, and STRENGTH!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:

perhaps explains its ability to conceal its form while submerged.
I believe the origins of mermaid folklore lie with this Pokémon.

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across WOBBUFFET! And it's got the ability TELEPATHY!
Apparently it is Lv. 73 and has a RELAXED nature. Seems to know SPLASH, COUNTER, CHARM, and CHARM!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* To keep its pitch-black tail hidden, it lives quietly
in the darkness. It is never first to attack.
Score! Just outstanding.

It has a BRAVE nature, with the ability FRISK.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Resentment at being cast off made it spring into
being. Some say that treating it well will satisfy
it, and it will once more become a stuffed toy.
So astounding!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across MANECTRIC! And it's got the ability STATIC!
Apparently it is Lv. 54 and has a IMPISH nature. Seems to know TOXIC, SLEEP-TALK, SWAGGER, and MUD-SLAP!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* It rarely appears before people. It is said to nest
where lightning has fallen.
Score! Just intense.

> I ended up looking inside a damp, dark cave for new POKéMON. Should've brought an escape rope!

in icy waters.
Score! Just mind-boggling.

It has a MILD nature, with the ability CLEAR-BODY.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* They fire beams from the glassy, magenta orbs that resemble
eyes atop their heads, and they drift in shallow seas. During low
tide, they can sometimes be found on beaches, desiccated.
So dramatic!

> I ended up looking inside a damp, dark cave for new POKéMON. Should've brought an escape rope!

Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:

It survives on just one berry a day. Minimal eating is another
aspect of this Pokémon’s training.
So imposing!

Apparently it is Lv. 41 and has a MODEST nature. Seems to know ROCK-SMASH, COUNTER, PSYCH-UP, and ICE-BEAM!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Suffers perpetual headaches. If the agony grows too great,
Psyduck's latent power erupts, contrary to Psyduck's intent.
Ergo, I am exploring ways to ease the pain.
Score! Just splendid.

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

a well-built adult. Striving to become ever stronger, Machop
trains by carrying a Graveler on its shoulders.
Dazzling find!

a Kadabra; however, this remains unverified. I suspect that
the spoon Kadabra holds enhances its brain waves.
Score! Just breathtaking.

> Despite my best efforts, I wasn't able to catch that JIGGLYPUFF... Hopefully I find another one!

> I found DUSTOX! It appears to be Lv. 25 with the moves DEFOG, STRUGGLE-BUG, TOXIC, and NATURAL-GIFT
It has a BRAVE nature, with the ability COMPOUND-EYES.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Tends to be drawn to bonfires on dark nights. Difficult to chase
away from settlements because of the way it scatters highly
toxic scales.
So amazing!

According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 68 and knows ROUND, DETECT, BODY-SLAM, and DOUBLE-KICK

tatters—even the skin of Steel-type Pokémon.
Score! Just dazzling.

> I found CACNEA! It appears to be Lv. 98 with the moves MUD-SLAP, COTTON-SPORE, BELCH, and GROWTH
It has a SERIOUS nature, with the ability SAND-VEIL.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* The more arid and harsh the environment, the more pretty and
fragrant a flower Cacnea grows. This Pokémon battles by
wildly swinging its thorny arms.
So exhilarating!

According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 77 and knows MIMIC, ROCK-TOMB, MIMIC, and THUNDER
Nice, its ability is MAGNET-PULL!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Once the people of Hisui discovered that its red nose always
points north, they grew to rely on it greatly when traveling afar.
The nose seems to work in a similar way to ancient compasses.
Stellar find!

> Hey, look what I caught - CACTURNE! It's got quite a RELAXED nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 63 and knows SWORDS-DANCE, CUT, FOUL-PLAY, and NEEDLE-ARM
Nice, its ability is WATER-ABSORB!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* If a traveler is going through a desert in the thick of night,
Cacturne will follow in a ragtag group. The Pokémon are
biding their time, waiting for the traveler to tire and become
incapable of moving.
Stirring find!

It has a MILD nature, with the ability ILLUMINATE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:

> I decided to enter a forest on a nearby route to look for new POKéMON. So eerie...

> I found PINSIR! It appears to be Lv. 35 with the moves TAKE-DOWN, BRICK-BREAK, BODY-SLAM, and PROTECT
It has a GENTLE nature, with the ability MOLD-BREAKER.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* This Pokémon clamps its pincers down on its prey
and then either splits the prey in half or flings
it away.
So unusual!

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> I decided to enter a forest on a nearby route to look for new POKéMON. So eerie...

> I ended up looking inside a damp, dark cave for new POKéMON. Should've brought an escape rope!

Apparently it is Lv. 89 and has a QUIET nature. Seems to know TOXIC, ICY-WIND, SURF, and SNORE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Clamperl’s pearls are exceedingly precious.
They can be more than 10 times as costly
as Shellder’s pearls.
Score! Just outstanding.

> I decided to go back to the nearest POKéCENTRE and heal up the team. Time to refresh!

sand to protect itself rather than fight back.
So heart-stopping!

Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:

paths is not its strong suit.

Wondrous find!

It has a LONELY nature, with the ability MOXIE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* I suspect this Pokémon to be the true identity of a dragon
written of in ancient texts, which claimed that it razed an entire
village with white-hot beams from its maw.
So unbelievable!

Nice, its ability is TRUANT!
The description from the POKéDEX states:

it is content to loaf around motionless. It is rare to see this
Pokémon in motion.
Unusual find!

Nice, its ability is INFILTRATOR!
The description from the POKéDEX states:

give up its long-running blood feud with Zangoose.
Prodigious find!

Weezing, but the toxins it creates are more
potent than those of its counterpart.
So majestic!

Nice, its ability is ROCK-HEAD!
The description from the POKéDEX states:

Bewildering find!
