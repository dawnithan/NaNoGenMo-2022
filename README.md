# NaNoGenMo-2022
Generates a text-based description of a Pokémon adventure, as a fresh trainer aims to catch 'em all.

In 2020 I used a Markov Chain to generate video games - https://github.com/dawnithan/NaNoGenMo-2020

Last year I struggled to come up an idea, but was determined this time to come up with something at least!

The code for this ended up being very rough and intended mainly just to reach the goal, so it's not pretty. I stitched together the two JSON files by hand, as an example lol. I also added some ~~meows~~ mudkips at the end as buffer in case some programs didn't consider this to be 50k words.

It mainly works in a two-step process: one file to pull down Pokémon API data from https://pokeapi.co/, and then another file to take that data and fill in some templates.

See output.pdf for the result!
