Oh, I was also given a POKéDEX! This is what it had to say about my SWELLOW:

wings. Once two Swellow are gathered, they diligently take
care of cleaning each other’s wings.

> Hey, look what I caught - KABUTOPS! It's got quite a QUIRKY nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 91 and knows WATERFALL, TOXIC, SMACK-DOWN, and ROUND
Nice, its ability is BATTLE-ARMOR!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* The cause behind the extinction of this species is
unknown. Kabutops were aggressive Pokémon
that inhabited warm seas.
Radical find!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across GLOOM! And it's got the ability CHLOROPHYLL!
Apparently it is Lv. 75 and has a RASH nature. Seems to know TAKE-DOWN, SECRET-POWER, NATURE-POWER, and ENDURE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* What appears to be drool is actually sweet honey.
It is very sticky and clings stubbornly if touched.
Score! Just stupefying.

> I decided to go back to the nearest POKéCENTRE and heal up the team. Time to refresh!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across CORPHISH! And it's got the ability ADAPTABILITY!
Apparently it is Lv. 98 and has a GENTLE nature. Seems to know VICE-GRIP, CUT, WATER-PULSE, and SNORE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* It was originally a Pokémon from afar that escaped
to the wild. It can adapt to the dirtiest river.
Score! Just stupendous.

> I found SKITTY! It appears to be Lv. 88 with the moves TOXIC, COSMIC-POWER, RETALIATE, and FLASH
It has a ADAMANT nature, with the ability NORMALIZE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Skitty is known to chase around playfully after its own tail.
In the wild, this Pokémon lives in holes in the trees of forests.
It is very popular as a pet because of its adorable looks.
So excellent!

> Shoot! I nearly caught a MARILL, but it got away. Better luck next time...

> I found GIRAFARIG! It appears to be Lv. 8 with the moves REST, ATTRACT, DOUBLE-EDGE, and SNORE
It has a GENTLE nature, with the ability INNER-FOCUS.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Girafarig’s rear head contains a tiny brain that is too small for
thinking. However, the rear head doesn’t need to sleep, so it
can keep watch over its surroundings 24 hours a day.
So out of this world!

> Hey, look what I caught - DONPHAN! It's got quite a CALM nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 8 and knows ATTRACT, ENDURE, STONE-EDGE, and COUNTER
Nice, its ability is STURDY!
The description from the POKéDEX states:

could be destroyed. Using its massive strength, the Pokémon
helps clear rock and mud slides that block mountain trails.
Outstanding find!

It has a GENTLE nature, with the ability SWIFT-SWIM.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:

exploration. Its appearance hasn’t changed in
100,000,000 years, so it’s called a living fossil.
So mind-blowing!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across PORYGON! And it's got the ability DOWNLOAD!
Apparently it is Lv. 43 and has a QUIET nature. Seems to know SPEED-SWAP, SWAGGER, MAGIC-COAT, and BIDE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* It has no discernible heartbeat and does not seem to draw
breath, and yet it appears to function without issue. I cannot
even begin to explain this utterly bizarre anomaly.
Score! Just unreal.

> Hey, look what I caught - SEVIPER! It's got quite a MODEST nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 2 and knows ATTRACT, CONFIDE, SNATCH, and ROUND
Nice, its ability is INFILTRATOR!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Seviper’s swordlike tail serves two purposes—it slashes foes
and douses them with secreted poison. This Pokémon will not
give up its long-running blood feud with Zangoose.
Eye-opening find!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across NIDORAN-M! And it's got the ability RIVALRY!
Apparently it is Lv. 30 and has a QUIRKY nature. Seems to know HORN-ATTACK, DOUBLE-TEAM, SECRET-POWER, and HORN-ATTACK!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:

ground and even risk its life in battle to protect
the female it’s friendly with.
Score! Just dazzling.

It has a LAX nature, with the ability TRUANT.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Slakoth’s heart beats just once a minute. Whatever happens,
it is content to loaf around motionless. It is rare to see this
Pokémon in motion.
So majestic!

> I decided to enter a forest on a nearby route to look for new POKéMON. So eerie...

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> Hey, look what I caught - LILEEP! It's got quite a MILD nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 29 and knows SOLAR-BEAM, PAIN-SPLIT, ACID, and CURSE
Nice, its ability is STORM-DRAIN!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Lileep clings to rocks on the seabed. When prey
comes close, this Pokémon entangles it with
petallike tentacles.
Noteworthy find!

> I found WINGULL! It appears to be Lv. 21 with the moves SNORE, PROTECT, WATER-PULSE, and HIDDEN-POWER
It has a DOCILE nature, with the ability KEEN-EYE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* It soars on updrafts without flapping its wings.
It makes a nest on sheer cliffs at the sea’s edge.
So exceptional!

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> I took a stroll down a nice route full of people and POKéMON - I love the fresh, crisp air!

> Hey, look what I caught - DODRIO! It's got quite a DOCILE nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 62 and knows DOUBLE-HIT, FACADE, AIR-CUTTER, and THIEF
Nice, its ability is RUN-AWAY!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* One of Doduo’s two heads splits to form
a unique species. It runs close to 40 mph
in prairies.
Terrific find!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across SALAMENCE! And it's got the ability INTIMIDATE!
Apparently it is Lv. 69 and has a NAIVE nature. Seems to know DRAGON-DANCE, FACADE, SCARY-FACE, and FLY!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* While basking in the joy of flight generally keeps
this Pokémon in high spirits, Salamence turns into
an uncontrollable menace if something angers it.
Score! Just beautiful.

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across STARYU! And it's got the ability ILLUMINATE!
Apparently it is Lv. 8 and has a CAREFUL nature. Seems to know DOUBLE-EDGE, THUNDER, PSYWAVE, and ICE-BEAM!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Fish Pokémon nibble at it, but Staryu isn’t
bothered. Its body regenerates quickly, even
if part of it is completely torn off.
Score! Just unreal.

> I found SPEAROW! It appears to be Lv. 71 with the moves RAGE, WHIRLWIND, TRI-ATTACK, and GROWL
It has a LAX nature, with the ability SNIPER.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Inept at flying high. However, it can fly around
very fast to protect its territory.
So tremendous!

> I found MAGNEMITE! It appears to be Lv. 33 with the moves ROLLOUT, CURSE, GYRO-BALL, and DOUBLE-EDGE
It has a NAIVE nature, with the ability STURDY.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron
sphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it
emits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets.
So mind-blowing!

> Hey, look what I caught - REGIROCK! It's got quite a LAX nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 12 and knows ANCIENT-POWER, ROCK-POLISH, FOCUS-BLAST, and STONE-EDGE
Nice, its ability is STURDY!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Cutting-edge technology was used to study
the internals of this Pokémon’s rock body, but
nothing was found—not even a brain or a heart.
Fantastic find!

> I took a stroll down a nice route full of people and POKéMON - I love the fresh, crisp air!

> I found GEODUDE! It appears to be Lv. 41 with the moves DOUBLE-EDGE, STRENGTH, SECRET-POWER, and GYRO-BALL
It has a QUIRKY nature, with the ability STURDY.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Makes its home in mountainous regions, using its arms to climb
along harsh mountain roads. Can be troublesome—carelessly
kicking one will cause it to fly into a rage and chase after you.
So fantastic!

> Hey, look what I caught - DUSCLOPS! It's got quite a LAX nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 77 and knows BRICK-BREAK, SHADOW-PUNCH, SHADOW-SNEAK, and ROUND
Nice, its ability is PRESSURE!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* There are rumors that peeking inside its bandage-wrapped body
will cause one to get pulled in through the gaps between the
bandages, never to return. I've been too scared to verify.
Unreal find!

> I decided to enter a forest on a nearby route to look for new POKéMON. So eerie...

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across JYNX! And it's got the ability DRY-SKIN!
Apparently it is Lv. 19 and has a NAIVE nature. Seems to know PSYSHOCK, REFLECT, TRICK, and ROUND!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* The Jynx of Galar often have beautiful and
delicate voices. Some of these Pokémon have
even gathered a fan base.
Score! Just extraordinary.

> I found MAGNEMITE! It appears to be Lv. 92 with the moves CONFIDE, LOCK-ON, MAGIC-COAT, and DISCHARGE
It has a MILD nature, with the ability MAGNET-PULL.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron
sphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it
emits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets.
So super!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across GEODUDE! And it's got the ability SAND-VEIL!
Apparently it is Lv. 42 and has a NAUGHTY nature. Seems to know TOXIC, CURSE, AUTOTOMIZE, and MUD-SPORT!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Makes its home in mountainous regions, using its arms to climb
along harsh mountain roads. Can be troublesome—carelessly
kicking one will cause it to fly into a rage and chase after you.
Score! Just awe-striking.

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across PONYTA! And it's got the ability FLAME-BODY!
Apparently it is Lv. 60 and has a CALM nature. Seems to know RETURN, STOMP, MIMIC, and GROWL!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:

foals lack their fiery manes, which will develop about an hour
after birth.
Score! Just stirring.

> I found JIGGLYPUFF! It appears to be Lv. 82 with the moves LIGHT-SCREEN, BUBBLE-BEAM, SELF-DESTRUCT, and BIDE
It has a HARDY nature, with the ability FRIEND-GUARD.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* By freely changing the wavelength of its voice,
Jigglypuff sings a mysterious melody sure to
make any listener sleepy.
So sensational!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across KANGASKHAN! And it's got the ability EARLY-BIRD!
Apparently it is Lv. 28 and has a HASTY nature. Seems to know ICE-BEAM, ICE-PUNCH, AERIAL-ACE, and TRUMP-CARD!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* There are records of a lost human child being
raised by a childless Kangaskhan.
Score! Just noteworthy.

> I found SPHEAL! It appears to be Lv. 3 with the moves ROUND, SIGNAL-BEAM, ICY-WIND, and ENCORE
It has a RASH nature, with the ability ICE-BODY.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* During the season when drift ice approaches the shore, Spheal
prefers living on the ice—where fewer predators lurk—rather
than the land. Its fur retains heat superbly and resists harsh cold.
So staggering!

> Hey, look what I caught - SHELLDER! It's got quite a MODEST nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 47 and knows BRINE, TRI-ATTACK, SURF, and ICE-BEAM
Nice, its ability is OVERCOAT!

Wondrous find!

It has a LAX nature, with the ability KEEN-EYE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* It feeds on gemstone crystals. In darkness, its
eyes sparkle with the glitter of jewels.
So incredible!

> Hey, look what I caught - BARBOACH! It's got quite a RASH nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 75 and knows BULLDOZE, RETURN, DOUBLE-EDGE, and MUD-SPORT
Nice, its ability is HYDRATION!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility
hides this Pokémon from predators, and the slime on its body
makes grasping it difficult.
Monumental find!

> I took a stroll down a nice route full of people and POKéMON - I love the fresh, crisp air!

> Hey, look what I caught - SNORUNT! It's got quite a HASTY nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 83 and knows SUBSTITUTE, MIMIC, SNORE, and SWAGGER
Nice, its ability is INNER-FOCUS!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Arrives alongside the first snow. It's thought that homes Snorunt
visit will prosper for many generations. By tradition, one might
offer a lump of ice made from pure water at one's front door.
Uncommon find!

> I took a stroll down a nice route full of people and POKéMON - I love the fresh, crisp air!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across GRIMER! And it's got the ability POISON-TOUCH!
Apparently it is Lv. 85 and has a MODEST nature. Seems to know SPIT-UP, PAIN-SPLIT, DOUBLE-TEAM, and FIRE-BLAST!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Made of congealed sludge. It smells too putrid
to touch. Even weeds won’t grow in its path.
Score! Just extraordinary.

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across NUMEL! And it's got the ability OWN-TEMPO!
Apparently it is Lv. 48 and has a SASSY nature. Seems to know OVERHEAT, FRUSTRATION, SWAGGER, and SWALLOW!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Numel stores magma of almost 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit
within its body. If it gets wet, the magma cools and hardens.
In that event, the Pokémon’s body grows heavy and its
movements become sluggish.
Score! Just stupefying.

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across LINOONE! And it's got the ability PICKUP!
Apparently it is Lv. 6 and has a BASHFUL nature. Seems to know ENDURE, SWAGGER, GUNK-SHOT, and GUNK-SHOT!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* It uses its explosive speed and razor-sharp claws
to bring down prey. Running along winding
paths is not its strong suit.
Score! Just moving.

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> I found RAYQUAZA! It appears to be Lv. 99 with the moves ROCK-SLIDE, HIDDEN-POWER, SCALE-SHOT, and SLEEP-TALK
It has a GENTLE nature, with the ability AIR-LOCK.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* It flies forever through the ozone layer, consuming
meteoroids for sustenance. The many meteoroids
in its body provide the energy it needs to Mega Evolve.
So magical!

According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 24 and knows MIMIC, HYPER-BEAM, ATTRACT, and RETURN
Nice, its ability is SHIELD-DUST!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* The powdery scales on its wings are hard to
remove from skin. They also contain poison
that leaks out on contact.
Humbling find!

> I found DUSKULL! It appears to be Lv. 40 with the moves NIGHTMARE, ALLY-SWITCH, ICE-BEAM, and DREAM-EATER
It has a LAX nature, with the ability LEVITATE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* I've heard that the children of Hisui all begin to behave once
they've been told the story of how this Pokémon roams about
before the witching hour to spirit away misbehaving children.
So extraordinary!

> I ended up looking inside a damp, dark cave for new POKéMON. Should've brought an escape rope!

> I found GOLEM! It appears to be Lv. 11 with the moves EXPLOSION, MUD-SLAP, FISSURE, and SEISMIC-TOSS
It has a ADAMANT nature, with the ability STURDY.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* The rocklike shell is shed each year. The cast-off shell then
crumbles, reverting to a mass of soil, which can be spread across
fields to promote crop growth.
So rare!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across CUBONE! And it's got the ability ROCK-HEAD!
Apparently it is Lv. 21 and has a RASH nature. Seems to know IRON-HEAD, BRICK-BREAK, LEER, and BONE-RUSH!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* This Pokémon wears the skull of its deceased
mother. Sometimes Cubone’s dreams make it cry,
but each tear Cubone sheds makes it stronger.
Score! Just miraculous.

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across MACHOP! And it's got the ability GUTS!
Apparently it is Lv. 50 and has a BOLD nature. Seems to know SUBMISSION, LOW-SWEEP, FIRE-PUNCH, and FACADE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Though as small as a child, it has strength enough to easily throw
a well-built adult. Striving to become ever stronger, Machop
trains by carrying a Graveler on its shoulders.
Score! Just rare.

> I found KINGDRA! It appears to be Lv. 8 with the moves FLASH-CANNON, IRON-HEAD, SLEEP-TALK, and ROUND
It has a TIMID nature, with the ability SWIFT-SWIM.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Scales shed by this Pokémon have such a
splendorous gleam to them that they’ve been
given to royalty as gifts.
So dazzling!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across BELLSPROUT! And it's got the ability CHLOROPHYLL!
Apparently it is Lv. 89 and has a SERIOUS nature. Seems to know CONFIDE, BULLET-SEED, HEADBUTT, and FACADE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Prefers hot and humid places. It ensnares
tiny bugs with its vines and devours them.
Score! Just eye-opening.

> I decided to enter a forest on a nearby route to look for new POKéMON. So eerie...

> I found SLOWBRO! It appears to be Lv. 28 with the moves REST, SUBMISSION, FURY-CUTTER, and ICY-WIND
It has a GENTLE nature, with the ability REGENERATOR.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Being bitten by a Shellder shocked this Pokémon
into standing on two legs. If the Shellder lets go,
it seems Slowbro will turn back into a Slowpoke.
So extraordinary!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across KADABRA! And it's got the ability INNER-FOCUS!
Apparently it is Lv. 3 and has a RASH nature. Seems to know PSYCH-UP, GUARD-SWAP, MIRACLE-EYE, and DRAIN-PUNCH!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* There are rumors that a child with mystical powers became
a Kadabra; however, this remains unverified. I suspect that
the spoon Kadabra holds enhances its brain waves.
Score! Just intense.

> I found ARCANINE! It appears to be Lv. 39 with the moves ENDURE, FLAME-CHARGE, REFLECT, and MUD-SLAP
It has a NAUGHTY nature, with the ability INTIMIDATE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its
bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a
deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.
So great!

> I found ELECTRODE! It appears to be Lv. 31 with the moves TELEKINESIS, REST, SHOCK-WAVE, and HEADBUTT
It has a ADAMANT nature, with the ability SOUNDPROOF.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in
composition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pokémon lets
loose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts.
So super!

> Hey, look what I caught - EXEGGUTOR! It's got quite a JOLLY nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 97 and knows WOOD-HAMMER, NIGHTMARE, MIMIC, and HYPNOSIS
Nice, its ability is HARVEST!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* When they work together, Exeggutor’s three
heads can put out powerful psychic energy.
Cloudy days make this Pokémon sluggish.
Impressive find!

> I found MR-MIME! It appears to be Lv. 24 with the moves BRICK-BREAK, ENERGY-BALL, SEISMIC-TOSS, and SOLAR-BEAM
It has a BRAVE nature, with the ability FILTER.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* The behavior of this clown-like Pokémon reminds one of
pantomime. It creates invisible walls using a force emitted
from its fingertips.
So excellent!

> I found TANGELA! It appears to be Lv. 69 with the moves THIEF, SNORE, FRUSTRATION, and SWORDS-DANCE
It has a BRAVE nature, with the ability LEAF-GUARD.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* It is cloaked entirely in blue vines, preventing any glimpse of
its true identity. The vines impart a refreshing sensation when
chewed—they're useful as a spice.
So unbelievable!

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> Hey, look what I caught - DELCATTY! It's got quite a BRAVE nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 68 and knows SHOCK-WAVE, GROWL, ROUND, and SUCKER-PUNCH
Nice, its ability is CUTE-CHARM!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Delcatty sleeps anywhere it wants without keeping a permanent
nest. If other Pokémon approach it as it sleeps, this Pokémon
will never fight—it will just move away somewhere else.
Majestic find!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across BULBASAUR! And it's got the ability CHLOROPHYLL!
Apparently it is Lv. 27 and has a JOLLY nature. Seems to know SUBSTITUTE, CURSE, FRUSTRATION, and TACKLE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* While it is young, it uses the nutrients that are
stored in the seed on its back in order to grow.
Score! Just formidable.

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> Hey, look what I caught - CLAMPERL! It's got quite a QUIET nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 89 and knows TOXIC, ICY-WIND, SURF, and SNORE
Nice, its ability is RATTLED!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Clamperl’s pearls are exceedingly precious.
They can be more than 10 times as costly
as Shellder’s pearls.
Enthralling find!

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> Shoot! I nearly caught a HARIYAMA, but it got away. Better luck next time...

> Hey, look what I caught - MAWILE! It's got quite a BOLD nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 16 and knows INCINERATE, TOXIC, SWEET-SCENT, and PAIN-SPLIT
Nice, its ability is SHEER-FORCE!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* It chomps with its gaping mouth. Its huge jaws are
actually steel horns that have been transformed.
Superior find!

> I found LANTURN! It appears to be Lv. 63 with the moves SUPERSONIC, SCREECH, SPARK, and FLASH
It has a MILD nature, with the ability ILLUMINATE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* This Pokémon flashes a bright light that blinds
its prey. This creates an opening for it to deliver
an electrical attack.
So moving!

> I found SLAKING! It appears to be Lv. 99 with the moves CHIP-AWAY, SEISMIC-TOSS, INCINERATE, and ATTRACT
It has a RASH nature, with the ability TRUANT.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* Wherever Slaking live, rings of over a yard in diameter appear
in grassy fields. They are made by the Pokémon as it eats all
the grass within reach while lying prone on the ground.
So prodigious!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across WURMPLE! And it's got the ability RUN-AWAY!
Apparently it is Lv. 67 and has a HARDY nature. Seems to know POISON-STING, SNORE, BUG-BITE, and SNORE!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Likes sap and is abundant in the wild. Why it evolves into
various different forms is unknown. One cannot tell from a
Wurmple's appearance which form it will take when it evolves.
Score! Just impressive.

> I took a stroll down a nice route full of people and POKéMON - I love the fresh, crisp air!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across MINUN! And it's got the ability MINUS!
Apparently it is Lv. 82 and has a HARDY nature. Seems to know FLING, SECRET-POWER, DOUBLE-EDGE, and ATTRACT!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Minun loves to cheer on its partner in battle. It gives off sparks
from its body while it is doing so. If its partner is in trouble,
this Pokémon gives off increasing amounts of sparks.
Score! Just majestic.

> Hey, look what I caught - CASCOON! It's got quite a SERIOUS nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 69 and knows BUG-BITE, HARDEN, IRON-DEFENSE, and HARDEN
Nice, its ability is SHED-SKIN!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* The silk coating its body is thin but sufficiently strong. Cascoon's
silk has a luster and texture superior to that of Silcoon's, and
clothes made using Cascoon silk are regarded as top-notch.
Terrific find!

> Whoa, you won't believe it; I stumbled across EXPLOUD! And it's got the ability SOUNDPROOF!
Apparently it is Lv. 35 and has a HASTY nature. Seems to know FAKE-TEARS, SLEEP-TALK, EARTHQUAKE, and ATTRACT!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* This Pokémon can do more than just shout. To
communicate with others of its kind, it’ll emit all
sorts of sounds from the holes in its body.
Score! Just fantastical.

> Hey, look what I caught - LOUDRED! It's got quite a IMPISH nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 54 and knows INCINERATE, BITE, THUNDER-PUNCH, and POWER-UP-PUNCH
Nice, its ability is SOUNDPROOF!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* The force of this Pokémon’s loud voice isn’t just
the sound—it’s also the wave of air pressure that
blows opponents away and damages them.
Sublime find!

> I found SKARMORY! It appears to be Lv. 6 with the moves STEEL-WING, SUNNY-DAY, METAL-SOUND, and SLEEP-TALK
It has a TIMID nature, with the ability KEEN-EYE.
Here's what the POKéDEX has to say about it:
* People fashion swords from Skarmory’s shed
feathers, so this Pokémon is a popular element

So fantabulous!

> Despite my best efforts, I wasn't able to catch that VOLTORB... Hopefully I find another one!

> Hey, look what I caught - SEAKING! It's got quite a SERIOUS nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 65 and knows FACADE, HYPER-BEAM, HEADBUTT, and FURY-ATTACK
Nice, its ability is SWIFT-SWIM!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Using its horn, it bores holes in riverbed
boulders, making nests to prevent its eggs from
washing away.
Noteworthy find!

Nice, its ability is SPEED-BOOST!
The description from the POKéDEX states:

its beak and with outstandingly destructive kicks. This
Pokémon’s cry is very loud and distracting.
Fabulous find!

> I ended up looking inside a damp, dark cave for new POKéMON. Should've brought an escape rope!

Apparently it is Lv. 45 and has a CALM nature. Seems to know BRINE, DOUBLE-EDGE, AQUA-JET, and WATER-GUN!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* Anorith can swim swiftly by pulling its eight wings
through the water like oars on a boat. This
Pokémon is an ancestor of modern bug Pokémon.
Score! Just spectacular.

hop to get around. It is always staring
at something.
Impressive find!

Apparently it is Lv. 68 and has a MODEST nature. Seems to know OUTRAGE, BOUNCE, DRAGON-BREATH, and HEADBUTT!
Oh, and here's what the POKéDEX says:
* They swim with dance-like motions and cause
whirlpools to form. Horsea compete to see which
of them can generate the biggest whirlpool.
Score! Just fantabulous.

According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 66 and knows VENOSHOCK, SHADOW-BALL, ROUND, and COUNTER
Nice, its ability is GLUTTONY!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* Swalot has no teeth, so what it eats, it swallows whole, no
matter what. Its cavernous mouth yawns widely. An automobile
tire could easily fit inside this Pokémon’s mouth.
Stupendous find!

> I went to the POKéMART to stock back up on potions and POKéBALLS. Always be prepared!

> Hey, look what I caught - TORKOAL! It's got quite a DOCILE nature.
According to my POKéDEX, it's Lv. 75 and knows EARTH-POWER, FLAME-CHARGE, FACADE, and ROLLOUT
Nice, its ability is SHELL-ARMOR!
The description from the POKéDEX states:
* You find abandoned coal mines full of them.
They dig tirelessly in search of coal.
Magical find!

> I took a stroll down a nice route full of people and POKéMON - I love the fresh, crisp air!

> Shoot! I nearly caught a KYOGRE, but it got away. Better luck next time...

Phew, time to take a break! I got quite a lot done, wouldn't you say?
Did I manage to become a POKéMON master? Let's take a look at the stats:
